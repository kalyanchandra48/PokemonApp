## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (optional, for Android development)
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (optional, for iOS development)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-flutter-project.git
   cd your-flutter-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment:**

   Follow the official Flutter documentation for setting up your environment on [Windows](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows), [macOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/macos), or [Linux](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/linux).

## Running the Project

1. **Connect a device or start an emulator:**

   Ensure you have an emulator running or a physical device connected. You can use Android Studio to start an emulator or use the command line:

   ```bash
   flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
   ```

2. **Run the project:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

   This command will compile and launch the application on the connected device or emulator.
